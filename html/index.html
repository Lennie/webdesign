					<h2>Freedom from web 2.0's monopoly platforms</h2>
					<p>
						<strong>Unhosted is a project for strengthening free software against hosted software</strong>. With our protocol, a website is only source code. Dynamic data is encrypted and decentralised, to per-user storage nodes. This benefits <strong>free software</strong>, as well as <strong>scalability</strong>, <strong>robustness</strong>, and <strong>online privacy</strong>.

				<h3>How does unhosted work?</h3>
				<div id="explanation">
					<p>
						A website is a specific web app, <strong>hosted</strong> on a specific server farm. There is a limited number of <strong>big centralized websites</strong>, that we all connect to. This is not how the web was intended to be.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Unhosted web apps</strong> are not hosted on one specific server farm. They use <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/" target="_blank">CORS</a> to offload each user's encrypted data to where this specific user has specified in his <a href="http://webfinger.org/" target="_blank">WebFinger</a>. The once-important server farms now become <strong>commodity infrastructure</strong>.

					<p>
						We need people to write unhosted web applications. We already got a few first demo apps out of our <a href="HackyHolidays.html">'Hacky Holidays' competition</a>, but we need more apps, and more complete ones. If you are able to write an unhosted web app, then you will be one of the first people in the world to have done that. If you don't know what unhosted is, read our <a href="manifesto.html">manifesto</a> first. We also have a <a href="https://github.com/michiel-unhosted/unhosted/wiki/" target="_blank">wiki</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						Get our <a href="https://github.com/michiel-unhosted/unhosted/tarball/v0.1">tarball</a> from github and play around with the 'hello world' examples. There is one Pub/Sub-model example and one messaging-model example. From there, take your inspiration and put a cool app together. If you get stuck with how to do something and want some advice, ask your questions on the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/unhosted" target="_blank">mailing list</a> and we'll answer them there. The third example is about cryptography and especially for the ubergeeks among us, but you won't need that one to win.
					</p>
					<p>	
						To make an unhosted web app work, you need to program all functionality client-side, and in a distributed architecture, so a bit of JavaScript skills come in handy, as does experience with scalability design. It's the perfect puzzle challenge for frontend developers, backend developers, sysadmins, and everyone inbetween! :)

						You can use the hello-world examples from the <a href="https://github.com/michiel-unhosted/unhosted/tarball/v0.1">tarball</a> as a starting point. They include a Pub/Sub-model wappblog and a messaging-based wappmail example.

							<strong>The <a href="protocol.html">UJ/0.1 protocol</a> and the <a href="StarSign.html">StarSign0.1 pki</a> are very basic, and there are many things that can (and probably should) be added to them.</strong> Like support for federation, compatibility with CCN, improvement of security, designing a browser to browser discovery & friending mechanism, etcetera.
