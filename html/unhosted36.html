<H2>Episode 2</H2>
26 March 2011
<p>
Another week, another bit of progress:
</p>
<ol>
<li> First unhosted web app now live! :) This is a big milestone for us, and we're quite pleased to have reached it yesterday. Our demo of the unhosted "CORS+WebFinger+OAuth2+DAV" architecture: http://www.myfavouritesandwich.org/ - to try it out, log in using chromium or chrome (doesn't work in firefox yet), as demo@demo.redlibre.org, password: demo. Or if you are the administrator of a domain name, you can set up your own unhosted storage node using the instructions I sent to this mailing list earlier today, and log in to myfavouritesandwich as yourself@yourowndomain.
</li>
<li> YouTube killer progress: Kenny nearly has his content-addressable media server ready. It will be called 'playbox' and is written in node.js with libtorrent and ffmpeg. It will form the basis of the unhosted youtube alternative that we will start designing soon.
</li>
<li> GoogleDocs killer progress: We published our vision on how LibreOffice could benefit from Unhosted (http://vimeo.com/21387223), basically moving the browser into LibreOffice instead of moving LibreOffice into the browser. We also talked to the UNG project about the possibility of collaboration. As a third possibility we're also still thinking about creating our own simple text editing application, possibly based on AbiWord's xmpp-based document sharing. 
</li>
</ol>

<H2>Episode 1</H2>
19 March 2011
<p>
In an attempt to be an open project, I'll tell you a bit about what's going on here on our side. Today, Javier (edokoa at unhosted dot org), Kenny (kenny at unhosted dot org) and I have moved into a basement in Kreuzberg (a popular zone for artists and hackers in Berlin). We will probably move somewhere else soon, but at least we have a nice place to live and work until the end of this month.
</p><p>
We plan to start accepting donations in April.
</p><p>
Apart from finding our way around Berlin, this week, we've made the following progress:
</p>
<ol>
<li> Javier is finishing a motion graphic that explains why LibreOffice should use unhosted for document sharing and cooperation. I've seen parts of it and it's becoming a very funny video. You'll see it when it's finished! :)
</li>
<li> Kenny is working on a node.js program that can stream music and videos from your hard disk. This is part of what we call the "YouTube killer", and will allow artists to share their work on the web without using commercial web software like YouTube.
</li>
<li> With help of several people here on the list, and on IRC, I found out how an unhosted storage node can be accessed with OAuth2. I think I have this working now, which is great because I think it makes a lot more sense than the password-passing and PopShake we had been looking at so far.
</li>
<li> This afternoon, I found out how to configure apache to do DAV+CORS. Combined with OAuth2, this gives us pretty much everything we had in the KeyValue service (only migration has to be out-of-band still, but we'll see what we can do about that). I'll publish an installation script that sets up OAuth2+CORS+WebFinger+DAV on a debian server.
</li>
<li> I'm preparing a tutorial and an example unhosted web app (the tutorial explains the example app). I will publish the tutorial next week, and also set it up live so people can visit the app, use it, view the source code, open their firebug, etcetera. Hopefully, that will help web devs decide that now they can start developing their own unhosted web apps.
</li>
</ol>
