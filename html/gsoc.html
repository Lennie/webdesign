						<strong>Unhosted is a project for strengthening free software against hosted software</strong>. With our protocol, a website is only source code. Dynamic data is encrypted and decentralised, to per-user storage nodes. This benefits <strong>free software</strong>, as well as <strong>scalability</strong>, <strong>robustness</strong>, and <strong>online privacy</strong>.

<h2>Google Summer of Code</h2>
<h3>Ideas for student projects</h3>

The Unhosted Project has stirred a lot of interest at its inception this winter, by proposing a new architecture for the web as we know it. If you believe in the importance of software freedom on the web, and think you are the right person to develop some of the first apps to populate the unhosted web, then this is your project.
<br><br>
<h3>What can I do?</h3>
There are two main approaches: starting from the product, or starting from research (although we also allow other project approaches, see below). Both product-oriented and research-oriented projects should start with a study, and end with a live unhosted web app. We propose a few suggestions here, but you are encouraged to investigate a technology or a product that is not listed here.

<br><br>
<h3>Projects that start by defining the product</h3>
These are a few examples of products that are popular on the hosted web, and that need porting to the unhosted web:
<ul>
<li> an unhosted calendar application
<li> an unhosted wiki
<li> an unhosted text editor
<li> an unhosted multi-player game
<li> any other web app that you currently use on the hosted web
</ul>
In all cases, indicate why you chose that product to work on, and not any of the others. Here, on purpose, we have only given a product name, or product category, even. Whichever one you choose, please give a more specific definition of the product you would like to develop. Try to be precise in how you describe what the product should be, and what it should do. If you choose a product-oriented project, your mentor will guide you through the <strong>Product Development process</strong> from start to finish, and you will learn about the very different aspects involved in this, including planning, product design, prototyping, testing, versioning, and organizing focus groups to test your product with real end users. Apart from with your mentor, who will guide you through the software development process, you will get help from our full-time graphics and user interface designer, who will help you make your end product look smart and professional, while you get to concentrate on the code. Although the difficulty depends entirely on the scope you define for your product, these projects can be done relatively easily. We will accept one, or maximum two students in this category, and your mentor is likely to be Kenny Bentley (one of the co-founders of unhosted, kennyb in the IRC channel).
<br><br>
<h3>Projects that start by researching a technology</h3>
Another option is to explore a certain technology, and demo it in an appropriate unhosted web app. Examples of technologies we know we need:
<ul>
<li> Video streaming as an unhosted service
<li> Git as an unhosted service
<li> Google Wave as an unhosted service
<li> A Distributed Hash Table as an unhosted service
<li> any technology that you think would be a necessity for use in some unhosted web apps
</ul>
In all cases, indicate why you chose that technology to work on, and not one of the others. Here, on purpose, we didn't specify why these technologies would be useful, nor why they would be non-trivial to implement. In your application, please specify roughly how you think that technology could be useful - for instance, maybe you want to use a DHT to store a social search index of something, or use git for some collaborative editing application. Here, the focus is more on the <strong>Research and Development process</strong> than on product-oriented development. If you're not sure which category to choose, ask around at your university, or in our IRC channel (#unhosted on irc.freenode.net) for advice. The guidance you get from your mentor would be structured more along the lines of research, experimentation, benchmarking, prototyping, analysis, underpinning your design choices with hard data, and not less important: making something that works. Although the focus here is more on what goes on under the hood, you will also get guidance from our full-time graphic designer / user interface expert, to make sure your end product after 6 weeks of hard work is shiny and awesome. Research-based projects are generally a bit harder than product-based projects, in the sense that there is a realistic possibility that you will fail in reaching your goal, even if you did all you could. R&amp;D is like that. We allow one, or maximum two research-based project, and your mentor will be Michiel de Jong (the other co-founder of unhosted, michiel_unhosted in the IRC channel).
<br><br>
<h3>Other projects</h3>
You may also propose any other project you think would help bootstrap the unhosted web. One example we have thought of ourselves, would be integrating unhosted into Google Web Toolkit, or porting an unhosted service to Google App Engine. If you think of applying for this kind of 'free style' projects, do make extra sure that you ask for feedback in #unhosted on irc.freenode.net first.
<br><br>
<a name="apply"><h3>How to apply</h3></a>
It is in your, as well as in our interest, that we get some information about your application, before we decide whether we can match you to one of our mentors. First of all, come and say 'hi' in our IRC channel, as well as on our mailing list. That way we can get to know each other a bit, and talk about what sort of project you would like to do. Also, apart from the general application procedure, we ask you to answer the following questions in your GSoC application:
<ul>
<li> Please provide a means of contact (email address or otherwise)
<li> Tell us some things you've done in the past, that show that you can program (especially JavaScript)
<li> For product-oriented projects, describe in a bit more detail what your product would be like.
<li> For research-oriented projects, describe why you think this specific technology needs to be made available ASAP to developers of unhosted web apps.
</ul>
